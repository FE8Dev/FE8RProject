# Tutorial
## need to explain:
```
Weapon changes (Flash Step, Lance Guard, etc.)
The Elemental combo system.
Affinity Strike
Pairup
How arsenals work
promotions and master seal, including trainees
boss healthbars
consumable items having 2 modes of use.
cooldowns?


```
## ideas

you will use anna as the tutorial unit


you get a few scripted fights that need elemental combos to oneshot the enemy, otherwise they regen to full at the start of the turn. probably a high hp brigand without a weapon, stationary.

chests(weapon rack?) that let you change loadout, sword/axe/lance/bow of different elements, should probably add magic too
anna will change class when touching a chest(maybe they will be different units enterely? so the inventory swap is easier)

have two annas, one physical and one magical, to set up combos, pairup and so on
