# The Interface

There have been some changes to the interface. Now, there are 4 screens instead of 3.

## Inventory screen

You have 7 inventory slots now. In exchange, the part of the interface that showed things like damage, accuracy, avoid and crit is gone.

## Stats
Do you remember the part that showed an unit's condition? It's gone from this screen.

## Skills and status

This screen will show an unit's class skills and status.

## Promotion screen

If an unit has more than one promotion option, the following will be displayed:

* Promotion bonus
* Unit's new growths
* Usable weapons
* Class' description(in a help box)
* New class' skills

## Basic combat stats

These can be seen by hovering the cursor over any unit. They don't take in account unit's skills.

# Accessories

Similar to Thracia 776, there are held scrolls and other that give skills. These items have a slight negative effect, but their positive skill compensates it.

# Weapons

## Monster weapons

Instead of being items, monster weapons have their own weapon rank.

## Durability
This time you don't have to worry about durability. Instead, some weapons have a cooldown system, which makes them unusable for a few turns. Myrrh won't be at risk of losing her Dragonstone.

## Staves
Staves here don't work like in the original games. There are several kind of staves:
* Support staves: They can only be used by support classes. Support classes have a staff icon in their description.
* Offensive staves. These staves can be used to attack and don't have the support class restriction. Some of these staves will always hit, giving staff users a safer attack option. They have the downside of not being able to crit.

## Damage formulas
Some weapons use damage formulas that aren't the classical Strength for physical weapons and Magic for magical weapons. Some weapons use Speed instead of Strength. Other weapons have a formula that uses 2 or more stats. If a weapon uses more than one stat, its description will show the damage unit's stats will add. There are also combat staves and tomes that use Strength. If a weapon uses a formula that isn't the usual, it will be mentioned in the description. Physical units that have low Strength can do actual damage. *That's good.*

## Heavy weapons
* For those that didn't play Engage, heavy weapons always attack later and can't double the enemy. Here they're also effective against frozen enemies.
* Like their name suggest, they have a high weight.
* These weapons will shove the attacked unit.
* In general, the heavy versions of weapons are the following:
  * Blades(swords)
  * Greatlances(lances)
  * Warhammers(axes)
* Heavy weapons can also come as tomes or bows, they aren't limited to the classic weapon triangle.

## Extra effects
Some weapons have special properties besides the typical for their type. These properties include but aren't restricted to skills, combat arts, status effects, stats improvement and even water walking.

## Multi-weapons
There are items that contain more than one weapon. These weapons can't be stolen from enemies.

## Weapon Experience

The curve for weapon experience changed. It takes 60 wexp to increase range, unlike the original where the wexp you needed to increase range varied. This means that you'll start raising your weapon rank slower than in vanilla.

## Bows

Bows have better range than in the original. Most bows have 2-3 range.

## Axes

Axes have a skill that add part of enemy's current HP to damage dealt and reduces enemy's defense.

## Swords

With most swords, if your unit's Attack Speed is high enough, you'll get an extra attack besides the one you get for doubling.

## Lances

Lances have a skill named Lance Guard that has several upgrades. It reduces damage taken that scales with unit's Skill.

## Dark Magic

Dark magic adds part of unit's missing HP to damage, reduces enemy's Res and inflicts Shadow and Curse.

## Other changes to existing weapons
* Gleipnir finally does effective damage against monsters. *Everyone liked that.*
* Both the Slim Sword and the Slim Lance give WEXP faster and use Speed in their damage formula.
* Fire magic(not only the Fire tome) is effective against Horse units.
* Thunder magic(not only the Thunder tome) is effective against Armor units.
* Light magic and daggers will do extra damage when doing a critical hit. This means that even if a normal hit would do 0 damage, you'll damage the enemy with a critical hit.
* Eirika's Rapier has 1-2 range.
* Sieglinde and Siegmund are also effective against Armor and Horse enemies.

# Bosses

From chapter 5 onwards, bosses will have an ability that works like in Engage(the boss will revive a number of times). Those bosses will also have special weapons with bigger range and an ability that lets them counter at any distance. You can't steal those weapons either. You can't cheese them with bows or light magic.

## Minibosses
Starting in chapter 7 there will be minibosses that drop weapons. Some of these bosses have the revival skill that the boss of the chapter has, but weaker.

# Weapon triangle
Weapon triangle's effects can be higher than in the original games. They can affect your critical hit rate against enemies.

Bows are part of the weapon triangle and have advantage against magic.

# Weather
Some unit's have a Prf weapon with a skill that summons a weather. You can stack several weather effects, but it will require effort. It's okay, weather doesn't slow down your units.

# Growths
Growth rates are now visible in your unit's info.

Your units' growths can change in several ways:
* Promoting: Now, besides gaining stats, your units get bonus growths upon promoting. A unit that starts purely physical/magic can end up being a mixed attacker.
* Conversations: some base convos can improve an unit's growths.
* Held items: items that used to be stats boosters or promotion items are now held items that among their effects, can improve an unit's growth rates. Metis Tome has its effects improved.

All your units have Con and Mov growths, so they have a chance to level up those stats. *Finally, lightweight units like Lute won't be weight down by everything.*


# Pair Up
For those that didn't play Awakening or Fates and don't know what Pair Up is, Pair Up is a mechanic that has things in common with Rescue.
* You combine two units and keep safe one of the units.
* Pair Up isn't affected by an unit's constitution.
* Pair Up gives bonus to the lead unit, with the bonus depending on the class of the secondary unit. The higher tier an unit is, the higher the bonus that unit gives will be. The total bonus depends on the unit's current and past classes. Examples:

  * Wyvern Knight Tana and Wyvern Knight Cormag give different Pair Up bonuses. While they both give bonus from the Wyvern Knight class, Tana also gives bonus from the Pegasus Knight class and Cormag gives bonus from the Wyvern Rider class.
  * Asassin Joshua and Asassin Colm give bonus from the Asassin class. Joshua gives bonus from the Myrmidon class and Colm gives bonus from the Thief class.
* The type of Pair Up bonuses are the following(if two bonuses are listed together it's because they count as the same):  

    * Lord/Manakete
    * Knight
    * Cavalier
    * Pegasus
    * Priest/Cleric
    * Fighter
    * Pirate
    * Archer/Thief
    * Monk/Dancer
    * Mage
    * Myrmidon
    * Mercenary
    * Wyvern
    * Shaman

> Fun tip!: Priest/Cleric Pair Up makes lead unit inmune to negative status and heals a bit of health at the start of the turn.

* There's a gauge meter that increases by 2 every time your unit attacks or is attacked(missing counts for this). When the meter reaches 10, the next attack from the enemy won't hit. *This one is from Fates*
* When two units are Paired Up, they can use a combat art named Affinity Strike. If the unit kills the enemy, gains Galeforce, but stats are reduced by 90% for a turn, else, they inflict a status that depends on the Pair Up partner's affinity.
* Enemies can be paired up too and they have a skill that makes them deal more damage when they're Paired Up.
* Affinity Strike's status inflicted depending on the affinity are:
  1. Fire -> Seared
  2. Wind -> Breached(8)
  3. Thunder -> Stunned
  4. Dark -> Cursed/Shadowblight
  5. Light -> Reduced Vision
  6. Ice -> Frozen
  7. Anima -> (has a 50% chance of inflicting each of Seared, Drenched, Cursed/Shadowblight, Frozen and Rock Punctures)


# Bonus Experience
Bonus Experience(BEXP) is a mechanic introduced in FE9. It allows you to give experience to your units with the cost being increasing with your unit's level and tier. Certain actions like visiting villages or houses(now you have an incentive to visit them) can give you more BEXP. Clearing a map before a turn limit will give you more BEXP. Clearing a level of the Tower of Valni or the Lagdou Ruins also gives BEXP. 

# Options
## RN
In Hard and Lunatic mode, there are options of 1RN and 2RN. They correspond to the type of RN in hit rate.
* 1RN: Hit Rate is what it looks like. It doesn't lie to you. 70% is 70%. Used in older games.
* 2RN: It takes two random numbers and if the average of those numbers is lower than the displayed hit rate, it will hit. Hit rates lower than 50% are even lower and hit rates higher than 50% are even higher. Used in GBA FE.

## Growths modes
When you start a new game, they'll ask you to choose a growths mode.
* Random: nothing special is done to level ups.
* Dynamic: it's made so you aren't RNG screwed. It prevents extreme results.
* Fixed: your units' stats will basically turn out like the averages that pages like SerenesForest and FireEmblemWoD talk about. Long explanation: there's a counter that every time an unit level ups increases depending on that stat's growth. When that counter reaches 100, that stat increases and 100 is discounted from that counter. This is done for every stat that has a growth.

# Units
## The Lords
Both Eirika and Ephraim will have access to the convoy and seize regardless of which route you chose.

Eirika and Ephraim's classes have higher stat caps than other classes from the same tier.

The Lord of the route you didn't choose will return as a Tier 3 unit in chapter 15. That Lord will also have the skills from the Tier 2 class.

## Paragon
Your trainees and Myrrh have the Paragon skill(makes the unit gain Experience faster) when they join. They will lose it upon promoting.

## Optional Trainees
### Franz
You have the option to have Franz join as a Sword trainee or have him come as a Cavalier. He has some special promotions if he starts as a trainee.

His T1 classes besides Sword Cavalier are Knight and Mercenary.

### Natasha
Natasha's T1 classes if you choose to have her start as a Trainee are Cleric, Troubador and Medic.

## Trainees
Your classic trainees have a special ability that increases their crit chance by their internal level.
T0 units can only be given BEXP when they have 0 exp.

Your trainees also have three T1 promotions.
* Ross can promote to Fighter, Pirate or Oni Brigand.
* Amelia can promote to Knight, Soldier or Wyvern Rider.
* Ewan can promote to Mage, Shaman or Monk.

## Joining level
With the exceptions of Amelia, Ewan and Myrrh, units now come at a more reasonable level making easier to use them. Some will promote when you get them or before the map starts.

Beginning with chapter 10, units will begin at T2. At chapter 14, they'll be T3.

## Hard mode bonuses
Like in FE6 and FE7, units that start as enemies are stronger in Hard and Lunatic mode.

## Proficiencies
Each unit has an arsenal with their Prf weapons.

Your units will unlock and in some cases replace their weapons when they get the corresponding Weapon Experience. Some units will replace their Prf weapons after an event.

Some units have new dialog in their joining chapter that indicates their proficiencies and has them in red text, so you can notice it easier.

Your units' arsenals' description includes icons with their proficiencies, which gives a hint of what they can use on some promotions. Keep in mind that some units can't promote to classes that let them use the full arsenal. *Basically, they're the Samson and Arran of Prf weapons.*

Just because two units' arsenals have the same weapon types it doesn't mean that they'll play the same. Their Prf weapons can have different effects/properties.

## Seth
Seth starts weaker than in the official games. *He took a strong attack from Valter that nerfed, what did you expect?*
Luckly, he can regain his strength in two ocassions:

* His C support with Eirika.
* A base conversation in chapter 9(this conversation needs you to keep a certain healer alive).

Both of these events will give Seth stats and increase his growths.

## Orson
Do you know how in Vanilla everyone just trades his weapons and items away from him? You can't do that here.

All of his items are exclusive to him.

## New units
You can get optional some extra units. They have support bonuses with canon units. You can name them.

### Playable monsters
You can get your own monsters. They're optional and you can obtain them after beating certain maps, although a pair of monsters are obtained just before the map starts. They have their own arsenal.

If Lute and/or Knoll are alive, they can revive your fallen monsters after falling in combat even in classical mode.

Your Gorgon starts as a T2 and she counts as being a promoted Shaman. Your Cyclops also starts as a T2 and is considered a promoted Fighter.

Monsters only get promotion choices for T3 classes.

There's a new Monster line: the Tarvadour, a support class that is a horse type.

### My unit
You have the option of creating your Avatar. After chapter 1, a new location will appear in the world map. When creating the optional MyUnit, you'll have to choose a Boon(strong point), Bane(weak point) and a starting class(only excludes Lord classes) that includes monster classes.

A Shaman MyUnit can promote to Gorgon and a Fighter MyUnit can promote to Cyclops.

At levels 5 and 15 of each class, MyUnit will gain another skill from a list of 5 skills that belong to a class from the same tier. This skill can be from a Lord class.


# Free actions
Unlike the original, certain actions won't end your turn. Support conversations, Talk and using consumible healing items are free actions.

# Supports
Supports are now easier to obtain, more similar to how it works in Awakening.
* The limit of supports is that you can only have one A support. You can have all the B supports you want.
* If you got enough points in the previous map to trigger a conversation you can activate it from the base too.
* The range for getting support points is now is 2 spaces.
* There are more ways to gain support points besides ending turn near each other:
  * By interacting(using staves or dancing).
  * By battling on range of the partner.
  * By battling on pair up with a partner.

Support bonuses have been buffed to compensate the increased enemy power.

## Bond Supports

Some units have a invisible skill that allows them to give one-way supports like in FE15. Those bonuses are based on what that unit's Affinity bonuses give. The units that give these kind of bonuses are Eirika, Ephraim, Seth, Kyle, Tana, Innes and Ewan. In general, the units that receive bonuses are units that have some kind of connection and/or would make sense if they had support conversations in vanilla.

# Classes

## Tiers
Your units can go up to Tier 3, like in FE10. T3 classes have a level cap of 30.

## Promotions
Some units may start in the same class and/or promote to the same class, but their promotions can use different weapons or promote to different classes. When you're in the promotion screen, you can see the weapons that promotion uses and the skills it learns.

Both the Dancer and Manakete classes are T2 classes, which means that they only promote once.

T1 and T2 units promote automatically after their level cap, but they can promote earlier if you use a Master Seal at level 15 or later. The Master Seal won't be consumed after being used.

In general, promotions are made so that you don't discard weapons, but there are some exceptions.

## Skills
All classes learn skills by leveling up. Skills are learnt at levels 5 and 15.

Some classes have level 1 skills like Canto for mounted classes or the thief skills.

## Thieves
Stealing and opening locks is a bit different here.
* You don't need lockpicks to open chests/doors.
* You can steal enemy's unequipped weapons.
  * There are certain weapons that you can't steal to prevent cheesing certain enemies.
* You can steal with a full inventory and they will ask you what item you want to send to the convoy.
* If an enemy has at least an item that can be stolen, it will be indicated with a $ icon.
* Thief units that have sword rank can use daggers. Yes, there are thief classes that don't use swords: Brigands/Barbarians.
  * Daggers are in general 1-2 range weapons, so your sword locked thieves have better range than in the original.
* Units that have thief skills will retain those skills even if they promote to classes that aren't thief classes. You don't have to worry about choosing promotions for your thieves on fear that they would lose those skills. *Imagine a thief forgetting how to steal, that wouldn't happen here.*

## Ballistas
Ballistas became units instead of being items that your foot archers can use if there are enough uses left. Obviously, they can move, but have low movement. You can get your own ballista units by promoting Armor Knights or Archers.

## Mono cavs
Cavaliers can only use one weapon type here. Of course, thanks to branch promotions that can vary depending on the unit, your cavaliers can end up looking different from each other even if they start with the same weapon.

## Class changes
Some classes, for the purpose of effective damage, had their class type change(or added in some cases). In the early game, you may find that Mogalls count as flyers and that spiders count as Horses. This applies to their promotions too.

Mogalls can use their personal Light Magic.

Myrrh's Manakete class has a level cap of 30 instead of 20 like the other classes. 

Mage Knights use Anima Magic and Swords instead of Anima Magic and Staves. This means that Mage Knight won't be a promotion option for Troubadour.

Your actually playable Paladins(let's ignore Orson) can use Light Magic.

Knights can use more than a weapon type.

Wyvern Lords have Axes instead of swords.

Eirika's Great Lord class can use both combat and support Staves.

Ewan's promotions are special in the sense that he can keep Anima magic after promotion.

Dancer class counts as a promotion of Monk(Tethys already comes with T1 Monk skills).

# Base
Before a chapter's battle preparations, there's a base like in FE9 and FE10. In the base you can give BEXP to your units, see base conversations and activate support conversations. When you select Continue, you'll be sent to the battle preparations.

# The Turnwheel
The Turnwheel(a mechanic that was introduced in FE15) allows you to rewind to a previous point in a map. You have 7 charges that reset after a map.

# Elements
Magic and some physical weapons have elements associated. They can cause status and/or can deal supereffective damage and are the following:
* Light(in general, also uses Luck for damage in elemental weapons)
* Dark(in general also uses Constitution for damage in elemental weapons)
  * Related status: Shadow Blight. Lowers Luck and Avoid. Weak to Light weapons.

* Water(in general, also uses Skill for damage in elemental weapons)
  * Related status: Drenched. Lowers Magic and Resistance. Weak to Thunder weapons.

* Ice(in general, also uses Resistance for damage in elemental weapons)
  * Related status: Frozen. Lowers Speed and Movement. Weak to Heavy weapons.

* Fire(in general, uses Strength and Magic for damage in elemental weapons)
  * Related status: Seared. Lowers Strength and Skill. Weak to Wind weapons.

* Thunder(in general, also uses Movement for damage in elemental weapons)
* Wind(in general, also uses Speed for damage in elemental weapons)
* Earth(in general, also uses Defense for damage in elemental weapons)
  * Related status: Rock Punctures. Reduces Avoid, Defense and Constitution. Unit takes 25% of damage dealt.


Some weapons have more than one element at once.

If a weapon has an element(or more) associated, the description will indicate it.

# Residual damage
Here poison can be more dangerous. Both poison and venom can stack, so the HP loss at the start of the turn can be more harmful. There's also the bleeding status, that makes you lose HP at the start of the turn and lose speed. Of course, it stacks too. They don't kill player units or bosses.

# Effectiveness
There are more types of effectiveness here. We have effectiveness of unit type and effectiveness of status.
* Unit type:
  1. Horse
  2. Armor
  3. Flying
  4. Infantry
  5. Sword
  6. Magic
  7. Pirate
  8. Dragon
  9. Monster
* Status:
  1. Drenched
  2. Seared
  3. Shadow
  4. Frozen

Of course, this means that elemental weapons can be more dangerous.

When selecting one of your units, if an enemy can deal effective damage, that enemy will have a ! sign.

# Arena
You cannot longer farm EXP and money in the arena. Instead, you'll be able to battle normally an NPC that drops a weapon upon being defeated.

# Shops
Armories and vendors have a wider variety of items even during the first part of the game. Some have new accessories.

You can enter secret shops during the main campaign from the overworld. You don't have to worry because you skipped a Secret Shop during its chapter.

## Discount
The bad news is that the Silver Card doesn't exist here. The good news is that there are a few classes that learn an skill that reduces the shop prices.

# Post battle roaming
Taken from Engage, this mechanic allows you to interact with the map after clearing a map. You can do the following:
* Train with an ally. You can talk to an ally unit and raise a stat that you want for both your Lord and that unit. *Your main Lord will need those extra stats to survive, specially in higher difficulties.* You can train up to 4 times for chapter.
* Talk with NPCs. You can talk with NPCs placed outside their houses that will give you BEXP.
* Other interactions. If you see a shiny spark, and interact with it, it can produce events, that can include small reinforcements.

# Tower of Valni and Ruins of Lagdou
If you cleared a level of the Tower or the Ruins, when you return you'll be given the option to skip that level. You won't have to go through weak enemies when you want to grind in the Tower.

Clearing later levels of the Tower and the Ruins will give you random weapons.

Be careful, you can't leave a level of the Tower or the Ruins using Retreat like in the originals. You have to beat it to leave.

The Ruins aren't only populated by monsters now. There are human enemies there too. This means that Slayer can't solve all your problems there.

Both the Tower and the Ruins got a bit randomized. Enemy's placement and classes may vary. Enemies can also drop stat boosters.
