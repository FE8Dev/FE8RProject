            "speak;Moulder;It was over ten years ago, when the prince was just a child.|There was a ceremony at the castle, with a trick archer of sorts.",
            "speak;Vanessa;A trick archer?",
            "speak;Moulder;Yes.|He was a very famous and undeniably skilled archer from abroad.|He was to shoot a tiny target that had been placed in the distance.|However, in the middle of the show, someone stopped him from shooting.",
            "speak;Vanessa;Oh, no...|It wasn't-",
            "speak;Moulder;Yes, it was young Prince Innes.|He said, \u201cThat's not far enough!|Move the target back farther!\u201d|Then, he insisted on trying himself.",
            "speak;Vanessa;|That's so like him!",
            "speak;Moulder; Isn't it?|King Hayden tried to stop him, but...|Well, you know how he is.|He doesn't listen to anyone.|And so, it became a contest between our prince and this foreign archer.",
            "speak;Vanessa;So, what happened?",
            "speak;Moulder;First, they established the ground rules.|Each person was to shoot at the target.|If both arrows hit, they increased the range.|They simply continued to move the target back until one person missed the mark.",
            "speak;Vanessa;Sounds simple enough.",
            "speak;Moulder;Ah, but the two were evenly matched.|Every shot was a perfect bull's-eye.|The crowd cheered, and the target moved ever farther back...|But then it came to the turning point.|The foreign archer said, \u201cThis is no test. Let's move the target back more.\u201d|It seemed like bravado, but the archer actually had a clever tactic in mind.",
            "speak;Vanessa;Clever?|How so?",
            "speak;Moulder;They had been shooting for some time, and the archer's arms had grown weary.|Precision archery is far more taxing than the battlefield, you see.|So even though he was a skilled archer, he was at the limits of his endurance.|He was still hitting the mark accurately, but his arm was quivering more and more.|Everyone knew that the prince was on the verge of victory.",
            "speak;Vanessa;I don't understand.|They were shooting at the same target, shot for shot, right?|Why would moving the target make any difference?",
            "speak;Moulder;Yes, they were still shooting at the same target.|However, the archer suggested that they move the target much farther away...|Much farther than any child Innes's age could hope to loose an arrow to.",
            "speak;Vanessa;Oh, that IS clever!",
            "speak;Moulder;Even the archer, with his trained arms, was firing at his maximum range.|In fact, he almost missed the target!|Then, it was the prince's turn.",
            "speak;Vanessa;And...?",
            "speak;Moulder;It was clearly too far away for the young prince to hit the target.|But His Highness was undeterred.|He drew his string and fired up into the sky.|The arrow did not merely hit the target.|No, it was a perfect bull's-eye!|You see, the prince arced his shot to extend his range beyond its limits.|To hit a target this way requires incredible skill, but the prince did it.|And then he turned to the archer and said, \u201cShall we move the target back farther?\u201d|The archer looked so crestfallen.|He admitted defeat, and it was settled.",
            "speak;Vanessa;That's amazing...",
            "speak;Moulder;That it is.",
            "speak;Vanessa;Thank you very much, Father Moulder!|That's incredible!|I'm even more-",
