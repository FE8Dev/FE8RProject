            "speak;Ewan;The key is how many pebbles you put on the scales at first.|First, put eight rocks each on either side of the scale.|The side with the lighter rock will be higher than the other, right?|Or, if the sides are balanced, it means that the lighter rock is in the rest of the pile.|So that was one turn on the balance.|The rest is pretty easy to figure out.|Let's assume that the lighter rock was in the remaining pile of nine rocks...|Then you'd put three rocks on each side of the scale.|So that's the second turn.|If either side of the scale tips, then the rock is in one of those two piles.|If the scale is balanced, then the rock is one of the remaining three rocks.|So, now you've figured out which group of three pebbles has the lighter one.|What you do now is put one rock from this pile on each side of the scale.|Like before, if the scale tips to one side, the lighter pebble is on the scale.|If the scale is balanced, then the remaining pebble is the lighter one.|And that was the last turn on the scale.|Did you get all that?",
