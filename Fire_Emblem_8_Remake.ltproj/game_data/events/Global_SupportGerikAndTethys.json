            "speak;Tethys;What happened?",

            "speak;Tethys;But that knight spared your life.|Because of that, good things and better things have happened?",
            "speak;Gerik;What do you mean, Tethys?",
            "speak;Tethys;First of all, Chief, you're alive.|If you had died, all the good times you've had since that day, and all the joy you're sure to have from this day onward, wouldn't exist.|And another thing, because you lived, you made many friends and you met me.|I also don't think that knight thought you were pathetic.|I think he saw a young man with his whole life ahead of him.|That's why he let you go.",
            "speak;Gerik;Tethys...",
            "speak;Tethys;Yep.|I'm sure that's it.|So try thinking about it in a more positive light.",
            "speak;Gerik;Ha ha ha.|You're right.|I was a lot calmer after that.|And while I've had hard times, there've been far more good times.|I guess you could say I owe my success as a mercenary to that knight.",
            "speak;Tethys;Yep.|You've got your knight, and I've got my dancer.|Thanks to the two of them, the two of us are here now.|Say, Chief, why don't we become like them?|I think we should work at being inspirations to other people.",
